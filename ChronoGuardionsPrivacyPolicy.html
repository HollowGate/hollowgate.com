    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="muted">Last updated: January 7, 2026</p>

    <p>
      At Chrono Guardians, we take your privacy and the protection of your personal data extremely seriously. Our mobile application Chrono Guardians is a completely offline game designed with maximum user privacy in mind. We have deliberately avoided any mechanisms for collecting, transmitting, or processing personal data, so you can enjoy the game without any privacy risks.
    </p>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains what data (or lack thereof) we process, how we ensure its security, and what rights you have as a user. Please read this document carefully.
    </p>

    <h2>Data We Collect</h2>
    
    <h3>Personal Data</h3>
    <p>
      The Chrono Guardians app <strong>does not collect any personal data whatsoever</strong>. We do not request or receive any information that could identify you as an individual, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>First name, last name, or nickname;</li>
      <li>Email address;</li>
      <li>Phone number;</li>
      <li>Date of birth or age;</li>
      <li>Payment information (cards, wallets, etc.);</li>
      <li>Residential address or geolocation;</li>
      <li>Device identifiers (IDFA, Android ID, or similar);</li>
      <li>Any biometric data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Game Data</h3>
    <p>
      All data required for the game to function is stored <strong>exclusively locally on your device</strong>. This includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Progress through levels and the campaign;</li>
      <li>Amount of accumulated in-game currency (coins, crystals, etc.);</li>
      <li>List of unlocked characters, items, abilities, and upgrades;</li>
      <li>Information about in-game store purchases (if implemented as one-time local purchases);</li>
      <li>Game settings (volume, language, graphics, etc.);</li>
      <li>Saved games and achievements.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This data is stored in the device's internal memory or in the app's secure storage (e.g., Shared Preferences on Android or Keychain on iOS). It is <strong>never transmitted</strong> to our servers, third-party services, or any other parties. If you uninstall the app or clear its data, all this information will be permanently lost—this further confirms that we do not store it anywhere else.
    </p>

    <h3>Internet Access</h3>
    <p>
      Chrono Guardians is a fully offline game. The app does not establish any network connections and does not send or receive data over the internet. An internet connection is neither required nor used for any purpose.
    </p>

    <h2>App Permissions</h2>
    <p>
      We aim for minimal interference with your device. Therefore, Chrono Guardians <strong>does not request any system permissions</strong>, such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Access to the camera or microphone;</li>
      <li>Access to contacts or calendar;</li>
      <li>Access to location;</li>
      <li>Access to external storage (beyond the app's own internal storage);</li>
      <li>Access to notifications;</li>
      <li>Any other permissions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This makes the app as safe and non-intrusive as possible.
    </p>

    <h2>Advertising, Analytics, and Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      Chrono Guardians contains absolutely no:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>In-app advertising of any kind (banners, videos, interstitials);</li>
      <li>Analytics systems (Google Analytics, Firebase, AppsFlyer, etc.);</li>
      <li>User behavior trackers;</li>
      <li>Social integrations (sign-in with Google, Facebook, etc.);</li>
      <li>Any third-party SDKs that could collect data.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We do not partner with third-party services for data collection, processing, or monetization. The game is designed as a pure single-player experience with no external dependencies.
    </p>

    <h2>Children's Data Protection</h2>
    <p>
      Chrono Guardians is not specifically targeted at children under 13 years of age, but the game is family-friendly and safe for all ages. Since the app does not collect, store, or transmit any data, it fully complies with COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act) and similar child data protection laws in other jurisdictions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parents can be completely assured: a child playing Chrono Guardians faces no risks related to leakage or use of personal information.
    </p>

    <h2>Compliance with Legislation</h2>
    <p>
      Our policy has been developed in accordance with major international data protection standards, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>GDPR (Europe);</li>
      <li>CCPA (California, USA);</li>
      <li>COPPA (USA);</li>
      <li>Similar laws in other countries.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Due to the complete absence of data collection, we automatically comply with all these requirements without needing additional measures.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy as the app evolves or as legislation changes. Any significant changes will be reflected on this page with an updated "Last updated" date.
    </p>
    <p>
      We recommend periodically reviewing this page to stay informed about the current version of the policy.
    </p>
